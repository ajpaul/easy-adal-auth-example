# easy-adal-auth-example
This is a very basic way to use ADAL.js to authenticate a user against an Azure AD using only JavaScript. I used this as a PoC for authenticating an Angular2 app and an Aurelia app to prove that we could successfully authenticate against an Azure AD, despite challenges with Azure and SPA frameworks.
